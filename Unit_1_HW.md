## Robinhood Case Study - Overview and Origin
---
Robinhood was founded by Vladmir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in April 2013. The founders were roomates at Stanford that had moved into finance in New York City after graduation and then started two finance companies selling trading software to hedge funds.  Upon realizing that Wall Street firms were paying essentially nothing to execute trades while charging clients high commissions, they believed they could create a company with no commission trades that would be able to compete with the legacy brokerages. Since founding, they have held 18 rounds of funding totaling $2.2 billion. The funds come primarily from private equity and venture capital firms.


## Business Activities:
---
The main aim of the company is provide access to financial markets for everyday people, not just wealthy and well-connected investors.  This is the reason for their no commission trading model, which allows small investors to execute trades without concern for costs.

The company primarily targets new investors, which means a focus on younger demographics in the Millenial generation.  Their targeting has resulted in their primary users having a median age of 30.  Also, as a result of their targets typically having few to no assets, they are estimated to have total Assets Under Management (AUM) of $20 billion spread over 13 million users.

When the company originally entered into the market, no commission trades were either short-term promitional items or nonexistent.  This allowed them to compete with the traditional institutions such as Charles Schwab and E-Trade when the company first formed. It has now gained parity with both these institutions in total numbers of users, with 13 million as of May 2020, compared to 14.1 million for Charles Schwab and 5.2 million for E-Trade.

Robinhood's most popular programming and technology tools include Python, React, Git, GitHub and Docker. Python and React are used on Application and Data projects, along with 20 additional programs.  Git, GitHub and Docker are used on the DevOps side of the organization, along with 22 other programs.


## Landscape
---
Robinhood operates in the securities trading industry as a brokerage firm.  The largest five brokerage firms are large and well established, with most being founded in the 70's and 80's. Their size measured in AUM is detailed below: 
* Vanguard - $6.2 Trillion 
* Charles Schwab - $4.1 Trillion 
* Fidelity - $3.1 Trillion
* TD Ameritrade - $1.3 Trillion
* E-Trade - $346 Billion 

In comparison, Robinhood is dwarved by these firms when looking at AUM, coming in with an estimate of $20 Billion. 

When comparing the number of users, Robinhood is much more competitive at 13 million.  The top 5 companies have the following user numbers:
* Vanguard - 30.0 million 
* Charles Schwab - 14.1 million 
* Fidelity - 29.6 million
* TD Ameritrade - 11.5 million
* E-Trade - 5.2 million 

The major trends in the brokerage industry are that the largest brokerage firms are now moving to commission free trading models, and that the consolidation of some of the largest companies in the industry is underway. 

The move to commission free trading by the major brokerages was in response to companies like Robinhood coming into the industry and beginning to take away their market share. As these upstart firms continued to grow their user base, the largest companies were forced to change their business models to compete.

The other major trend in the brokerage space is the consolidation of some of the largest companies in the industry. Charles Schwab recently announced the acquisition of TD Ameritrade with an all stock transaction valued at $26 billion.  This merger will have industry wide impacts as one of its largest companies disappears, and Charles Schwab grows in size to be at parity with Vanguard and Fidelity as measured by user numbers and AUM.


## Results
---
Robinhood has made some major impacts to the brokerage industry since its 2013 founding.  The no commission model has proven highly effective at gaining market share and causing new investors to flock to the platform.  Their success has made such an impact that all of the major brokerages have adopted different variations of the no commission trading model in response.  

The major metrics that are used to measure the success of brokerage companies are user numbers and Assets Under Management (AUM). Using user numbers as a metric, Robinhood has been a major success, with its 13 million users comparing favorably to the major companies users, which range from 5.2 million to 30.0 million.  However, on an AUM basis, Robinhood is nowhere near comparable, with their estimated $20 billion AUM coming up far below the major brokerages, which have AUMs as low as $346 billion and as high as $6.2 trillion.

Robinhood has overall been a major success, and has been able to change the business practices of some of the largest brokerages in the world. Building on the company's already substantial user base, as their younger demographich clients continue to grow older and build wealth, the company will be able to compete with their largest competitors on an AUM basis as well. 


## Recommendations
---
The success of Robinhood's no commission trading model has allowed them to compete directly with the major brokerages and create a large user base.  With these competing firms begininng to use no commission models, the company will need to continue to innovate in order to retain their competitive edge.  The next product they should consider offering is robo advisory services which would assist their generally younger and more inexperienced user base make better investment decisions.

Currently, the company offers a Robinhood Gold account, which costs $5 a month and provides some Morningstar reporting and access to more data such as Level 2 quotes. However, like their standard accounts, there are no advisory options. As other start-up competitors such as Wealthfront and Wealthsimple continue to develop their advisory products, Robinhood's standard and premium accounts will look less desirable. A robo advisory product, whether paired with their premium accounts or given to all users, would help Robinhood continue to grow their user base and consequently their AUM.

Robo advisors are typically built using Python based languages and use financial time series data to analyze stock performance over time. Based on this data, algorithims are built that identify ideal investment opportunities. The result of these algothirims generate proposed portfolios that are appropriately diversified to achieve shareholder returns with varying levels of risk.  Companies will have their users complete questionnaires to gauge their risk tolerance and their long term investing goals, and then match these goals with their algorithmically derived portfolios.

Robinhood is alread a FINRA regulated broker-dealer and is registered with the SEC, so the company has a natural avenue to the infomration in public markets.  Additionally, the company has an ongoing partnership with Morningstar to provide investment reports to their Gold premium members.  Using their already existing access to large volumes of data, a Python based solution would be effective in the creation of a robo adviser, due to Python's strength when dealing with large volumes of data. In addition, Python is already one of the primary languages that Robinhood utilizes and so their internal development teams are already comfortable with the program.  

If Robinhood were to create robo advisory options using Python based language, the company would continue to grow their market share and build upon their already impressive success since being founded. By adding robo advisory programs to their platform, Robinhood would open up new avenues for income generation and give them an additional competitive edge over both competing start-ups and legacy institutions.
